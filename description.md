Interactive maps and architecture analysis help you write better Java, Python and Ruby code.

# AppMap for IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm and RubyMine

Navigate your code more efficiently with interactive, accurate software architecture diagrams right in your IDE. 
In less than two minutes you can go from installing this extension to exploring maps of your code's architecture. 
AppMap helps you:

- Onboard to code architecture, with no extra work for the team 
- Conduct code and design reviews using live and accurate data
- Troubleshoot hard-to-understand bugs using a "top-down" approach.

Each interactive diagram links directly to the source code, and the information is easy to share.
